# What is array?
An array is a collection of similar type of data items and each data item is called an element of the array.

The elements of array share the same variable name but each element has a different index number known as subscript.

# Why do we need an array?

A variable can contain a single value at a time.Consider, a situation where we have to store and display 77 students roll number we have to do following:

1. Declare 77 diffrent variables to store roll numbers.
2. Assign a value to each of the variable.
3. Display each of the variable.

However, we as a programmer able to perform task but, all the above task would be difficult to manage.
Here concept of array comes into play where we can use array and we can store multiple values in a single array.
